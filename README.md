# üßÆ Python-Based Calculator Application

## üìå Overview
This project is a fully modular and extensible calculator application built with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and design patterns to ensure **maintainability, scalability, and testability**.

The application follows core software engineering principles, including:
- **SOLID Principles** (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **GRASP** (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)
- **Separation of Concerns** (Modular architecture)

It provides an **interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)** where users can execute mathematical operations, manage calculation history, and extend functionality through a **plugin system**.

## üõ† Features
‚úîÔ∏è Supports fundamental arithmetic operations (**Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide**)  
‚úîÔ∏è Implements a **REPL-based command execution system**  
‚úîÔ∏è Saves and loads calculation history using **Pandas & CSV**  
‚úîÔ∏è Implements **plugin support** for extending functionality dynamically  
‚úîÔ∏è Includes **comprehensive unit tests** with pytest and **code coverage analysis**  
‚úîÔ∏è Uses **design patterns** to enforce maintainability and extensibility

## üìê Architecture & Design Patterns Used
This project follows **industry-standard design patterns** to ensure modularity and reusability:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Facade Pattern
- **Where?** `calculations.py` (Manages Pandas operations)  
- **Why?** Encapsulates the complexity of loading, saving, and managing history using Pandas, providing a simple interface for other components.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Command Pattern
- **Where?** `commands/` (Handles REPL commands dynamically)  
- **Why?** Enables commands like `add`, `subtract`, `history` to be executed independently while maintaining loose coupling.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Factory Method Pattern
- **Where?** `calculations.py`  
- **Why?** Instantiates the history manager dynamically while allowing subclassing if needed.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Singleton Pattern
- **Where?** `calculations_global.py`  
- **Why?** Ensures only one instance of the history manager exists throughout the application.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Strategy Pattern
- **Where?** `operations.py`  
- **Why?** Dynamically selects the appropriate calculation strategy (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
